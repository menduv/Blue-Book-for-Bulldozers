Hello!
This is a Jupyter Notebook file that predicts the sale prices of bulldozers sold at actions. I have made a Random Forests 
object to predict the values. I have also used bagging technique. I have split the Bulldozer_train.csv file into a train 
and validation set. I have stored the predicted values in the csv file Bull.csv and I have gotten the data from the Kaggle
Competition "Blue Book for Bulldozers".
